# what is the difference between var and let in javascript?

In JavaScript, var and let are both used to declare variables, but they have some key differences.

Scope: The main difference between var and let is that var variables have function scope, while let variables have block scope. This means that a variable declared with var inside a function can be accessed from anywhere within that function, while a variable declared with let inside a block (e.g., within a loop or an if statement) can only be accessed within that block.

Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of the function or global scope, while variables declared with let are not. This means that a variable declared with var can be accessed before it is declared, while a variable declared with let cannot.

Temporal dead zone: Variables declared with let cannot be accessed before they are declared. This period of time from the start of the block until the variable is declared is called the temporal dead zone.

Re-declaration: Variables declared with var can be re-declared multiple times within the same scope, while variables declared with let cannot.

Scope:

```javascript

function exampleVar() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 5;
  }
  console.log(x); // Output: 5
}

function exampleLet() {
  if (true) {
    let y = 5;
  }
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
}

```


In this example, x is declared with var and is accessible within the entire function scope, including after the if statement. y is declared with let and is only accessible within the block scope of the if statement and will raise an error when trying to access it outside the block.

Hoisting:



```javascript

console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;

console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
let y = 5;
```


In this example, x is declared with var and is hoisted to the top of the scope, so it is accessible before it is declared. y is declared with let and is not hoisted, so it will raise an error when trying to access it before it's declared.

Temporal dead zone:




```javascript

console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
let x = 5;
```


In this example, x is declared with let and is in a temporal dead zone, it is not accessible until it is declared.

Re-declaration:



```javascript

var x = 5;
var x = 10;
console.log(x); // Output: 10

let y = 5;
let y = 10; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'y' has already been declared
```

In this example, x is declared with var and can be re-declared multiple times within the same scope, while y is declared with let and cannot be re-declared.

I hope these examples help to clarify the differences between var and let. Let me know if you have any other questions!
